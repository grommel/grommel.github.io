    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a theoretical physicist with a Ph.D. in Fundamental Physics and over 18 years of experience in academic teaching and research. My interests include gravitational effects in brane world scenarios, higher-dimensional spacetimes, and field localization. I have taught at universities in Venezuela and Ecuador, developed physics curricula, supervised numerous theses, and published in peer-reviewed journals. I am currently working on educational materials in Classical and Quantum Mechanics.
