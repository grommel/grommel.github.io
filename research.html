      <h2>Research Overview</h2>
      <p>
        My research focuses on gravitational effects in brane-world models, including domain wall structures, localization of fermions and gauge fields, and extra-dimensional geometry. I explore how fields interact with warped spacetimes in higher dimensions and contribute to the theoretical foundation of modern cosmological and field-theoretic models.

  <h4>Fermions Localization on de Sitter Branes</h4>
  <!--<p><strong>Rommel Guerrero</strong> & R. Omar Rodriguez (2019)</p>-->
  <p class="abstract">
    This paper investigates how fermions—fundamental particles with spin 1/2—can be naturally confined to a four-dimensional universe (a brane) within a higher-dimensional space. The brane itself has a de Sitter geometry, representing an expanding universe, and acts as a domain wall between two different five-dimensional spaces: one with positive curvature (de Sitter) and one with negative curvature (anti-de Sitter).
  </p>
  <p class="abstract">
    The authors introduce a specific interaction between fermions and a scalar field that generates the brane. This interaction makes it possible to trap a single massless fermion on the brane, even if the brane is extremely thin. In addition, they show that the brane can host a set of massive fermions: some of them are truly bound to the brane, while others are resonances—particles that linger near the brane for a time before escaping into the extra dimension.
  </p>
  <p class="abstract">
    The study reveals that the number and properties of these bound states depend on the asymmetry of the space surrounding the brane. The analysis draws from tools in supersymmetric quantum mechanics and connects with broader efforts to understand how gravity and matter can emerge from higher-dimensional theories. Influential works by Randall and Sundrum, as well as studies on thick branes and localization mechanisms, form the foundation of this research.

  <h4>SO(10) Thick Branes and Perturbative Stability</h4>
  <!--<p><strong>Rafael Chavez, Rommel Guerrero, R. Omar Rodriguez</strong> (2017)</p>-->
  <p class="abstract">
    This work explores three thick brane configurations derived from the non-abelian gauge group SO(10), embedded in a five-dimensional spacetime with gravity. Each brane arises as a domain wall solution connecting two different AdS<sub>5</sub> vacua, and is characterized by a distinct unbroken symmetry on the wall: <strong>SO(10)</strong>, <strong>SO(6) × SU(2) × U(1)</strong>, and <strong>SU(4) × SO(2) × U(1)</strong>.
  </p>
  <p class="abstract">
    The paper investigates both the construction and stability of these walls. It shows that although their flat-space counterparts are unstable due to tachyonic scalar modes, the inclusion of gravity stabilizes the system by suppressing these instabilities. Particularly, massless scalar modes—interpreted as Nambu-Goldstone bosons—become localized along the broken symmetry generators, while dangerous tachyonic modes are removed.
  </p>
  <p class="abstract">
    The analysis includes a supersymmetric quantum mechanics approach to understand the fluctuation spectrum. It also highlights how gravitational effects enhance the localization of scalar fields, and how the symmetry breaking patterns can give rise to phenomenologically interesting structures related to grand unification models like the Pati-Salam group.

  <h4>Newtonian Gravity and Resonance on de Sitter Branes</h4>
  <!--<p><strong>Adriana Araujo, Rommel Guerrero, R. Omar Rodriguez</strong> (2011)</p>-->
  <p class="abstract">
    This paper investigates how gravity behaves on a four-dimensional de Sitter (dS) brane embedded in a five-dimensional space with different curvatures on each side—specifically, asymmetric scenarios involving anti-de Sitter (AdS<sub>5</sub>) vacua. The authors focus on understanding whether standard Newtonian gravity can be recovered in such configurations.
  </p>
  <p class="abstract">
    The study reveals that gravitational fluctuations in this setup lead to a massless bound state (the zero mode) and a continuum of massive excitations. In some asymmetric cases, a <em>resonant mode</em>—a massive state with enhanced probability of localization on the brane—appears. Its contribution to gravity on the brane depends on how heavy or light it is: heavy resonant modes are suppressed, but light ones can noticeably alter the gravitational potential.
  </p>
  <p class="abstract">
    The authors analyze three scenarios: nearly symmetric AdS<sub>5</sub>, strongly asymmetric AdS<sub>5</sub>, and an AdS<sub>5</sub>-flat configuration. They find that Newtonian gravity is well reproduced in the first two, where the resonant mode is heavy. However, in the AdS-flat case, the resonant mode is light and leads to five-dimensional behavior dominating the gravitational interaction. The work builds on the foundational ideas of Randall–Sundrum models and contributes to understanding how dimensional asymmetries affect gravity at large scales.
