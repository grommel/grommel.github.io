      <h2>Research Overview</h2>
      <p>
        My research focuses on gravitational effects in brane-world models, including domain wall structures, localization of fermions and gauge fields, and extra-dimensional geometry. I explore how fields interact with warped spacetimes in higher dimensions and contribute to the theoretical foundation of modern cosmological and field-theoretic models.

  <h4>Fermions Localization on de Sitter Branes</h4>
  <!--<p><strong>Rommel Guerrero</strong> & R. Omar Rodriguez (2019)</p>-->
  <p class="abstract">
    This paper investigates how fermions—fundamental particles with spin 1/2—can be naturally confined to a four-dimensional universe (a brane) within a higher-dimensional space. The brane itself has a de Sitter geometry, representing an expanding universe, and acts as a domain wall between two different five-dimensional spaces: one with positive curvature (de Sitter) and one with negative curvature (anti-de Sitter).
  </p>
  <p class="abstract">
    The authors introduce a specific interaction between fermions and a scalar field that generates the brane. This interaction makes it possible to trap a single massless fermion on the brane, even if the brane is extremely thin. In addition, they show that the brane can host a set of massive fermions: some of them are truly bound to the brane, while others are resonances—particles that linger near the brane for a time before escaping into the extra dimension.
  </p>
  <p class="abstract">
    The study reveals that the number and properties of these bound states depend on the asymmetry of the space surrounding the brane. The analysis draws from tools in supersymmetric quantum mechanics and connects with broader efforts to understand how gravity and matter can emerge from higher-dimensional theories. Influential works by Randall and Sundrum, as well as studies on thick branes and localization mechanisms, form the foundation of this research.

  <h4>SO(10) Thick Branes and Perturbative Stability</h4>
  <!--<p><strong>Rafael Chavez, Rommel Guerrero, R. Omar Rodriguez</strong> (2017)</p>-->
  <p class="abstract">
    This work explores three thick brane configurations derived from the non-abelian gauge group SO(10), embedded in a five-dimensional spacetime with gravity. Each brane arises as a domain wall solution connecting two different AdS<sub>5</sub> vacua, and is characterized by a distinct unbroken symmetry on the wall: <strong>SO(10)</strong>, <strong>SO(6) × SU(2) × U(1)</strong>, and <strong>SU(4) × SO(2) × U(1)</strong>.
  </p>
  <p class="abstract">
    The paper investigates both the construction and stability of these walls. It shows that although their flat-space counterparts are unstable due to tachyonic scalar modes, the inclusion of gravity stabilizes the system by suppressing these instabilities. Particularly, massless scalar modes—interpreted as Nambu-Goldstone bosons—become localized along the broken symmetry generators, while dangerous tachyonic modes are removed.
  </p>
  <p class="abstract">
    The analysis includes a supersymmetric quantum mechanics approach to understand the fluctuation spectrum. It also highlights how gravitational effects enhance the localization of scalar fields, and how the symmetry breaking patterns can give rise to phenomenologically interesting structures related to grand unification models like the Pati-Salam group.

  <h4>Newtonian Gravity and Resonance on de Sitter Branes</h4>
  <!--<p><strong>Adriana Araujo, Rommel Guerrero, R. Omar Rodriguez</strong> (2011)</p>-->
  <p class="abstract">
    In this work, we study how gravity behaves on a four-dimensional de Sitter (dS) brane embedded in a five-dimensional spacetime with different curvatures on each side—specifically involving anti-de Sitter (AdS<sub>5</sub>) and flat geometries. Our goal is to determine under which conditions Newtonian gravity can be recovered on the brane.
  </p>
  <p class="abstract">
    We find that the spectrum of gravitational fluctuations includes a massless bound state (the zero mode) and a continuum of massive modes. In certain asymmetric configurations, a resonant massive mode appears, which is quasi-localized on the brane. The influence of this resonant state depends on its mass: heavier resonances are suppressed, while lighter ones can significantly modify the gravitational potential at large distances.
  </p>
  <p class="abstract">
    We analyze three cases in detail: nearly symmetric AdS<sub>5</sub>, strongly asymmetric AdS<sub>5</sub>, and a hybrid AdS<sub>5</sub>-flat configuration. In the first two, Newtonian gravity is effectively reproduced due to the suppression of the resonance. However, in the AdS-flat scenario, the resonance is light and leads to a five-dimensional behavior dominating the gravitational interaction. Our analysis extends previous results from the Randall–Sundrum framework and highlights the role of geometric asymmetry in brane-world gravity.

  <h4>Gauge Field Localization on Brane Worlds</h4>
 <!-- <p><strong>Rommel Guerrero, Alejandra Melfo, Nelson Pantoja, R. Omar Rodriguez</strong> (2009)</p>-->
  <p class="abstract">
    In this work, we study how gauge fields—like those that describe electromagnetism—can be confined to a four-dimensional brane within a higher-dimensional universe. We build on the Dvali–Gabadadze–Shifman (DGS) mechanism, which allows gauge fields to remain on the brane by adding a special kinetic term to its surface.
  </p>
  <p class="abstract">
    We first apply this mechanism to a thin brane in a warped spacetime and show that gravity plays an important role in how gauge fields behave. In particular, we find that recovering four-dimensional electromagnetism on the brane requires more restrictive conditions than previously thought. These constraints depend on the cosmological constant of the bulk and the gauge coupling strength.
  </p>
  <p class="abstract">
    We then analyze a more realistic thick brane model in flat space, where the brane is generated by a scalar field and supports localized fermions. In this setup, we find that the emergence of standard electromagnetism is limited to a narrow range of distances. Outside that range, the field spreads into the extra dimension and four-dimensional behavior is lost.
  </p>
  <p class="abstract">
    Our results show that gauge field localization is much more delicate than gravity localization, especially in thick brane models without warping. We conclude that the presence of gravity may be essential for achieving realistic gauge confinement on branes.

  <h4>Close to the Edge: Hierarchy in a Double Braneworld</h4>
  <p><strong>Rommel Guerrero, Alejandra Melfo, Nelson Pantoja, R. Omar Rodriguez</strong> (2006)</p>
  <p class="abstract">
    In this work, we propose a new way to explain the large difference between the Planck scale and the weak scale using an asymmetric double-brane system embedded in a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS<sub>5</sub>) spacetime. Our model consists of a single thick domain wall that naturally splits into two sub-walls, without the need for orbifold geometries or negative tension branes.
  </p>
  <p class="abstract">
    We show that fermions and gravitons tend to localize at opposite sides of the wall due to the warping of spacetime. Fermions are confined on one sub-wall (which we identify as the "weak brane") through a Yukawa interaction with a scalar field, while gravitons are localized on the opposite sub-wall (the "Planck brane"). This spatial separation creates an exponential hierarchy between the effective gravitational strengths on each brane.
  </p>
  <p class="abstract">
    The configuration is stable due to topological properties of the scalar field, and we demonstrate that Newtonian gravity is recovered on the branes. Our calculations confirm that the massive graviton modes are suppressed, and four-dimensional gravitational behavior emerges without the need for additional stabilization mechanisms or compactification of the extra dimension.
  </p>
  <p class="abstract">
    This model generalizes previous Randall–Sundrum scenarios and provides a natural explanation for the mass hierarchy, rooted in geometric asymmetry and field localization. We also outline directions for future work, such as gauge field and scalar field localization within this framework.
